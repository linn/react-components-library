# FileLoader docs

## Overview
This is a FileUploader which supports drag 'n' drop uploads as well as choosing a file via a file explorer.

Accepts a doUpload(data) function which invokes some action to enact the upload of the data of the chosen file (which will be converted to a string of data by the component).
Can render a list of errors (see the result prop) specific to your file, e.g. one for each line of a csv upload that failed.
