# FileLoader docs

## Overview
This is a FileUploader which supports drag 'n' drop uploads as well as choosing a file via a file explorer.

You can pass it a doUpload(data) function which invokes some action to enact the upload of the data of the chosen file (which will be converted to a string of data by the component).

You can also pass it a prepareUpload() function to do some prepatory work, e.g. clear prior errors or results.

It can render both an ErrorCard for http request errors, or a list of errors (see the result prop) specific to your file, e.g. one for each line of a csv upload that failed.

It can render a 'success' snackbar too.
