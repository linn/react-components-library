# DatePicker docs

This component renders and 'Are you sure?' style confirm modal dialog which you can use to add an extra confirmation step for users when they are performing actions.
It will offer some confirmation text, and then the option to either confirm and carry out the action, or cancel to abort the action, both via button clicks.

This component just provides the Dialog - you must implement the button or other mechanism for opening and closing the Dialog, and mangage its 'open' state externally. 
This provides the most flexibility since you can use the component in any way you want, i.e. it doesn't lock you down to a specific button or other interaction style for users performing actions.

The component closes itself when the user clicks either of the two buttons.

It takes the following props:

| Prop   |Type | Required/Default | Narrative
| -----------|----------------------------|------------------|--------------------        
| visible | bool | required | whether or not the modal is currently visible/open
| title | string | defaults to 'Are you sure?' | the big title text to show at the top of the modal
| confirmButtonText | string | defaults to 'Confirm' | the text to render on the confirm button
| cancelButtonText | string | defaults to 'cancel' | the text to render on the cancel button
| primaryText | string | defaults to null | An optional smaller piece of text to show the user
| secondaryText | string | defaults to null | An optional even smaller piece of text to show the user
| onConfirm | func | required | The action that you want to provide a confirmation stage for
| onCancel | func | null | An optional additional function to call on cancelClick (i.e. in addition to the default behaviour, which is just to close the modal)
| maxWidth | string | defaults to 'm' | How wide the modal is. s, m, l or xl
| closeDialog | func | required | The function the closes the dialog. This will conventionally set the state that is being passed in the 'visible' prop to false
