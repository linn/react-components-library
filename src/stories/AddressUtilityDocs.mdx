# Adress Utility
A simple utility used for creating addresses.
Can be rendered in two forms:

* <b>inDialogBox=false</b>: The component will render itself on a Page with breadcrumbs etc as if it were a standalone utility. The back click acts as normal, i.e. it redirects the users to the specified 'backUrl'
* <b>inDialogBox=true</b>: The component will expect to be rendered in a Dialog/Modal popover. As a result:

  * The component is not rendered on a Page component with Breadcrumbs etc. so you can style it in a Modal as desired.
  * The component will expect to be passed a closeDialog() function to call when the back button is clicked, as opposed to the history.push operations. 

The Component currently only supports creating an address. You can fill in the fields and when you click save the addressActions.add() action will be dispatched to create the address, and the snackbar will be rendered on success.

## Props
* <b>inDialogBox</b> - bool - Specifies which mode to render the utility in, as described above
* <b>closeDialog</b> - func - The operation to close the Dialog (and perform any after effects)
* <b>addressee</b> - string - Optionally pass this prop to set the addressee from an external source (e.g. so the user doesn't have to type it in) 
* <b>history</b> - obj - React router history with the push() function for redirecting
* <b>config</b> - obj - Our config object that includes the appRoot string.
* <b>addressActions</b> - obj - Address redux actions. The only two this component dispatches is add(address) when the Save button is clicked, and setSnackbarVisible to show feedback when save successful
* <b>countriesActions</b>  - obj - Countries redux actions - required for looking up countries. 
* <b>backUrl</b> - string - The url to redirect to when Back is clicked and inDialogBox=false
